# Surfs_Up
# Overview:
We have been tasked to analyze weather data for the months of June and December, this temperature data will be used to determine if the surf shop and ice cream shop will be able to sustain year-round. 

# Results:
In June the average temperature is 74.9, while the maximum is 85 and the minimum is around 64. In December, the average temperature is 71.04, while the maximum is 83 degrees and the minimum is 56 degrees. This data is based upon 1,700 points for June and 1.517 for December.  

# Summary:
The results show that 
 - The average temperatures in June and December are actually very similar with only a 3 degree variation in average temperature
 - The maximum temperature in December and June are similar with only one degree difference
 - However, the minimum temperature reflects an almost ten degree temperature difference, which is more impactful. 

Two additional queries here would be to analyze how many times in December and June are the temperatures the same, and another would to be to determine how often the max tempeatures and minimum temperatures occur in each month.
